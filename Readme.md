###Overview

A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

###Description

Friend Finder implements friend matching based on the user's responses to a ten-question survey. The user responds to questions with values from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Users can also access all friends by looking at /api/friends for JSON object of all friends.
